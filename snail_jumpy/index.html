					The original Snail jumpy was a primitive platforming game that a friend and I created
					in less than two weeks. Our goal when designing the game included: a limited scope, 
					small time frame, no engine, and all sounds made via human vocals. The end result was Snail Jumpy
					This primitive first game primarily served as an excellent learning
					experience, as my programming experience was quite limited.
					As a result, the source code is a complete mess. The game is won after you, the player
					collect a number of coins while dodging snails and collecting power-ups.

					Following the same idea of creating a game without a game engine, I learned about Handmade Hero,
					and Snail Jumpy was reborn. This new version of Snail Jumpy is more similar to an actual releasable game.
					As such, I like to consider the original Snail Jumpy as little more than a proof of concept.
					The new game will have sounds that are produced in the same fashion (except music), 
					a similar style of art, more enemies, more advanced gameplay, as well as being a more professional game.
